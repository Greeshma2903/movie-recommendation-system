## Setup Locally

### For the ML Model and Node server

> - Run the commands in your terminal/command line. 
> - Requirements: python3, pip, npm

1. Clone or download the repo on your local system, and navigate to the project directory.

2. Navigate to `server` directory
   ```bash
   cd 'server'
   ```
3. Setup the virtual environment to install the python packages

   > Virtualenv is a tool to set up your Python environments. ([read this for installation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/))

   ```bash
   # install virtual environment to your host python, if you haven't already:
      # pip install virtualenv
      # OR
      # python -m pip install virtualenv

   # use the virtual env
   python<version> -m venv env
   # example
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

   To activate the virual environment:

   ```bash
   # on mac or linux
   source env/bin/activate

   # on windows
   env/Scripts/activate.bat # in CMD line
   env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # in Powershell
   ```

4. Install all the libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file with the command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # OR
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Dectivate the environment after you're done with your work:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
6. To run the node server
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
7. For the project to work, you need get your API key from [TMDB's website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), and store it in a `.env` file in the `server` folder.
   ```js
   // .env file
   API_KEY=###
   ```

### Client

1. Go to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the server at localhost
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
